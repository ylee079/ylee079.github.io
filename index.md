Hello there!

Welcome to my personal website! I'm Yee Sien Lee, and I came into this world in 1999 in Johor, Malaysia. You can call me either Yee Sien or simply Lee, which is my surname. I'm thrilled to have you here, so let me take a moment to introduce myself.

On my website, I will be sharing a diverse range of content, including my engineering projects, book reviews, work trips, and personal experiences. It's a space where I aim to showcase my professional achievements, passions, and the journey that has led me to where I am today.

I am currently working as a Robotics Software Engineer at [LionsBot International Pte Ltd](https://www.lionsbot.com/) in Singapore, a remarkable company specializing in the development of autonomous cleaning robots. Since joining the team in July 2022, I have been primarily focused on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) while also nurturing a strong interest in perception. One of the aspects I absolutely love about my work is the incredible working culture within my team, where the best ideas always emerge victorious.

In May 2022, I proudly graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore with a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in Robotics and Mechatronics, achieving Honours (Highest Distinction). Additionally, I pursued a second major in Business, recognizing the importance of combining technical expertise with a solid understanding of the entrepreneurial landscape. Throughout my final year, I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Assoc Prof Pham Quang Cuong, undertaking a fascinating project involving peg-in-hole insertion with a robotic arm using deep visual servoing. I even had the opportunity to present my [work](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=01lfX8qrh1O) at the esteemed IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation 2022: Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Manipulation Workshop, which was an immensely rewarding experience.

During my third year at NTU, from 2020 to 2021, I had the opportunity to embark on a professional internship at [Garuda Robotics](https://garuda.io/), a drone company in Singapore. This experience proved to be highly valuable in shaping my skills and knowledge. In the initial part of the internship, I worked on a hardware design project, where I was tasked with designing a winching system for drone delivery of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs). This project allowed me to apply my engineering expertise to develop practical solutions. In the latter part of the internship, I focused on software development and gained proficiency in ROS (Robot Operating System), sharpening my programming skills in languages such as C++ and Python. It was during this period that I realized the immense potential of robotics and its impact on various industries.

Fueling my desire to apply my engineering skills to improve the world we live in, I eagerly participated in a module called "Product Development Challenge" in August 2019. Jointly organized by NTU and Dyson, the module focused on the theme of "Technology for the Aged." It entailed identifying challenges faced by the elderly in their daily lives and developing a product to address those challenges. Although it was my first foray into hands-on problem-solving, the excitement of tackling a real-world issue propelled me forward. Working closely with an NTU Professor and a professional Dyson engineer, my team of five successfully designed and built a prototype that facilitated the transfer of wheelchair users between their wheelchairs and other platforms. I am immensely proud of the collaborative effort that went into this project.

Even during my formative years in Foon Yew High School, Malaysia, I actively participated in speech and forum contests, honing my skills in public speaking and critical thinking. As part of a team of five, we achieved the remarkable feat of becoming champions in the national Malay Forum Competition in 2016. The following year, we secured the runner-up position, and I had the honor of being recognized as the best speaker in the competition. In July 2017, I took part in a wind band competition in Taiwan, where my high school band proudly won the gold medal. Additionally, I served as the leader of both the brass and tuba sections, fostering a sense of camaraderie and teamwork among my fellow musicians.

Beyond my engineering pursuits, I have a deep passion for politics, sports, music, and global affairs. These diverse interests have allowed me to cultivate a broad perspective on the world and engage with a wide range of topics. For sports, I enjoy watching football and badminton, and my favorite football team is Arsenal. Music plays a significant role in my life, and I am skilled in playing the piano and tuba.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. Feel free to explore my website further to discover more about my work, interests, and accomplishments.
